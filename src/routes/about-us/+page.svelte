      <p>
        At Avyathi, our mission is to address the growing threat of deepfake technology and ensure online safety for
        everyone. As an open-source project, we are dedicated to providing a secure platform for individuals to report
        incidents related to deepfake crimes.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Our primary focus is on empowering victims and users through a comprehensive directory of cyber-police cells. We
        understand the importance of reporting deepfake incidents promptly to mitigate the impact of these malicious
        acts. With Avyathi, individuals can easily connect with the appropriate authorities trained to handle
        deepfake-related cases efficiently.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In addition to the directory, we offer valuable insights and guidance on handling deepfake incidents. Our
        platform equips users with the knowledge needed to gather evidence, preserve digital footprints, and comprehend
        the complexities of deepfake technology during the complaint process. By arming victims with this information,
        we strive to help them build stronger cases and seek justice effectively.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We believe that combating deepfake technology requires a collective effort, and Avyathi's approach serves as a
        model for other organizations and individuals in the fight against digital crimes and the preservation of online
        safety.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Join us in our commitment to creating a future where technology is harnessed responsibly, and individuals can
        participate in the digital world without fear or vulnerability. Together, we can make a difference and build a
        safer online space for all. Welcome to Avyathi!
